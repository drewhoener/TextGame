JUST WEST OF NEOMAR CASTLE, JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS, PAST THE FINAL GUARD TOWERS, THERE IS A FOREST.
THIS IS THE FOREST OF _______. IT IS A DARK.  IT IS DESERTED. AND ACCORDING TO LOCAL LEGEND IT IS INHABITED BY ALL MANNER OF BEASTS,
THE LIKES OF WHICH ANY CITY DWELLER HAS ONLY SEEN IN NIGHTMARE.
NONE ENTER THIS FOREST, LEST THEY BE SWALLOWED WHOLE, DEVOURED BY THE WOODS, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.
THE CITIZENS OF NEOMAR CASTLE, AND INDEED THE ENTIRE FERRING PROVINCE, STAY AWAY FROM IT,
AFRAID TO EVEN SET EYES ON THE PATH THAT SOMEHOW ALWAYS SEEMS WELL WORN.
ITS THE SUBJECT OF TALL TALES, STORIES DESIGNED TO SCARE EVEN THE BRAVEST OF CHILDREN.
NO ONE WHO SEES IT EVER FORGETS IT, IT BECOMES THE BASE OF ALL FEARS, AND THE SUBJECT OF COUNTLESS NIGHTMARES.
IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD, THERE IS NOTHING MORE TERRIFYING THAN THE FOREST OF ______.
THEN WHY ARE YOU SPRINTING TOWARDS IT?

YOU DASH TOWARDS THE FOREST, SWEAT DRIPPING FROM YOUR BROW, LEGS STRAINING WITH EFFORT. THE CLANG OF WEAPONS AND ARMOR IS AUDIBLE JUST BEHIND YOU, FOLLOWING YOUR PATH.
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN SO SCARED

ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU COME TO A HALT. THE PATH INTO THE FOREST IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.
DESPITE YOUR URGENCY, YOU CAN’T HELP BUT PAUSE.
IS THIS THE RIGHT DECISION?

(On The Path)
YOU REALLY WISH YOU HAD DONE THIS DURING THE DAY, THOUGH FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
YOU RUN DOWN THE PATH, NARROWLY AVOIDING THE ODD ROOT AND BRANCH IN YOUR PATH.
YOU REALIZE IT MIGHT BE DANGEROUS TO KEEP RUNNING AT THIS SPEED.

SO YOU KEEP RUNNING.
FOR A WHILE YOUR NATURAL AGILITY KEEP YOU ON YOUR FEET, BUT YOU REALIZE YOU’RE SLOWING DOWN.
IT'S BEEN A LONG NIGHT, AFTER ALL.
COME TO THINK OF IT, ITS BEEN A LONG FEW YEARS.
THE CLATTER OF ACTIVITY FOLLOWING BEHIND YOU ISN’T GETTING CLOSER, BUT YOU DO THINK YOU MIGHT HEAR BARKING.
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THERE’S A SPLIT IN THE PATH.

THIS PATH SEEMS LIKE IT WILL NEVER END.
YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE RUNNING TOWARDS BECAUSE NO ONE HAS EVER MAPPED THESE WOODS, BUT YOU’RE PRETTY SURE WHATEVER IT IS, IT SHOULD BE CLOSE.
MEANWHILE, THE SOUNDS OF BARKING ARE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER WITH EACH EXHAUSTING MINUTE.
YOU’RE NOT SURE HOW LONG YOU CAN KEEP THIS UP, BUT YOU’RE NOT SURE STOPPING IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE.

SUDDENLY YOU’RE IN A CLEARING. A VERY MANMADE, SUSPICIOUS SORT OF CLEARING.
IT IS COMPLETELY ROUND AND HAS A STATUE OF A WOMAN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.
MEANWHILE, THE BARKS ARE INCREASING IN FREQUENCY AND DECREASING IN DISTANCE.
YOU REMEMBER HOW MUCH YOU HATE DOGS, AND HOW MUCH KING YOST LOVES THEM.

IT SEEMS TO BE THE NORMAL SORT OF STATUE, NOT THAT YOU’RE REALLY THE SORT TO KNOW.
NOW THAT YOU’RE CLOSE ENOUGH YOU CAN TELL THE WOMAN IS NAKED, AND HAS ANIMALS AROUND HER FEET.
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU’VE SEEN THIS IN SOME TEMPLE OR SOMETHING BEFORE.
IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN OUT IN THE WOODS FOR A WHILE, YOU CAN TELL FROM THE DAMAGE TO IT.
BOTH EYES ARE EMPTY, WHERE CLEARLY GEMS ONCE WERE INLAID.
THE TOP EDGES ARE WORN FROM RAIN AND SNOW, AND THE BASE IS ALL SCUFFED UP.
AND THROUGHOUT, YOU CAN’T IGNORE THE FACT THAT THE DOGS ARE DEFINITELY GETTING CLOSER

YOU CLIMB INTO THE HOLE, AND ARE MORE THAN A LITTLE RELIEVED TO FIND A LADDER.
YOU CLIMB DOWN, AND FIND YOUR FEET SUBMERGED IN WATER.
FROM THE SMELL OF THINGS, THIS SEEMS TO BE A SEWER.
MANY YARDS AHEAD OF YOU IS A LIGHT.

YOU OPEN THE DOOR AND FIND YOURSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF A CLOTH MERCHANT. YOU REALIZE THE NOISE YOU HEARD WAS OF THE MARKET. YOU’RE SOMEHOW BACK WITHIN THE CITY WALLS.
JUST AS YOU’RE ABOUT TO TAKE THE TIME TO COLLECT YOURSELF AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO, A SLIGHTLY OVERWEIGHT MAN COMES IN, SEES YOU, AND DROPS HIS ARMFUL OF FABRIC OUT OF SHOCK.
HE LOOKS YOU OVER, NOTICES WHERE YOU CAME FROM, AND SEEMS TO COME TO A REALIZATION.
HE CLOSES THE DOOR HE CAME THROUGH, AND TAKES A SEAT ON A PILE OF SILKS. YOU NOTICE HIM FINGERING A RELIGIOUS CHARM AROUND HIS NECK.
HE TELLS YOU THAT NO ONE HAS COME THROUGH THAT DOOR SINCE HE INHERITED THE SHOP. IN FACT, THIS STORE HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN GENERATION BY GENERATION, AND NO ONE HAS EVER COME THROUGH THAT DOOR. HE SAYS IT IS HIS DUTY TO HELP YOU, THAT YOU ARE THE ONE OF LEGEND.
YOU TELL HIM WHO YOU ARE, AND WHY THE GUARDS WERE CHASING YOU. YOU TELL HIM WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.
HE AGREES.
HE WILL HELP YOU KILL THE KING.
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE DISCOVERED ENDING A
